What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    An empty repository is created in the directory and a .git file appears. We need to initialze a repository so that we can be able to commit our files to it and have a track of each of those files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area helps in grouping a bunch of files to be commited together. We can group multiple files with same logical changes and add them on to the staging area to be committed later.
