When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I would be working on a project from multiple machines or I need to make the project public,
  I would use a remote repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The changes on the remote repository can be made by anybody if it is open to public.
    If we don't want that changes to be made in our local master branch we have to option of not pulling the commit.
    This might not be possible if the Git automatically pulls the changes to stay up-to-date.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Use of branch : When you want to make some experimental changes or add some new features to the code which
    for a while you don't want to include in the master branch.

    Use of clone : When you want to directly pull the repository from GitHub on your local machine.

    Use of fork : When you want to make a copy of a repository on GitHub first, and then pull it on your machine.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    The benefit for this is that we can keep track of whether the repository on both local and remote are out-of-sync or not.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    One way to collaborate without using GitHub is to share the files with all the collaborators via mail. 
    This seems to be tedious, and also it gets complex when there is a large number of collaorators.
