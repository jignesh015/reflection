When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I would be working on a project from multiple machines or I need to make the project public,
  I would use a remote repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The changes on the remote repository can be made by anybody if it is open to public.
    If we don't want that changes to be made in our local master branch we have to option of not pulling the commit.
    This might not be possible if the Git automatically pulls the changes to stay up-to-date.
